# Improved Vanilla

### I made some small changes to Vanilla Minecraft to make the gameplay a little better

### things I changed:

  - spawners are mineable with silk-touch pickaxes
  - right-click crops to harvest them
  - mobs can drop their spawn-egg at a 1% chance
  
  

config-file can be found in path-to-Minecraft-Folder/'Save-Name'/serverconfig/improvedvanilla-server.tomlÂ 
for Server-Hosters: needs to be installed on the server-side only
