# Improved Vanilla

### added some small features to Vanilla Minecraft to make the gameplay a little bit more pleasant/enjoyable

### things I changed:

 - spawners are mineable with silk-touch pickaxes
 - spawners drop spawneggs depending on the spawnpotentials
 - mobs can drop their spawn-egg at a 2% chance
 - right-click crops to harvest them
 - right clicking with seeds will fill the farmland in a small radius (gif below)
