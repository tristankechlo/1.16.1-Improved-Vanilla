# Improved Vanilla

### I made some small changes to Vanilla Minecraft to make the gameplay a little better

### things I changed:

- spawners are mineable with silk-touch pickaxes
- right-click crops to harvest them
- mobs can drop their spawn-egg at a 1% chance
- (1.16 only) right-click spawner to open GUI and edit the potential spawns
  - number of spawn-eggs inside is the chance that this spawn gets picked next, in comparison to other spawn-eggs 
  - number of spawn-eggs won't effect the number of spawned entities

### More explanation to Spawn-Potentials
#### Example 1 - same chance:

#### Example 2 - chance twice as high:
