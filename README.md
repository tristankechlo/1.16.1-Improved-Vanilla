# Improved Vanilla

### I made some small changes to Vanilla Minecraft to make the gameplay a little better

### things I changed:

- spawners are mineable with silk-touch pickaxes
- spawners drop spawneggs depending on the spawnpotentials
- right-click crops to harvest them
- mobs can drop their spawn-egg at a 2% chance


config file can be found with /config showfile improvedvanilla server
