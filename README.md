### added some small features to Vanilla Minecraft to make the gameplay a little bit more pleasant/enjoyable

### things I changed

- spawners are mineable with silk-touch pickaxes
- spawners drop spawn-eggs depending on their spawn-potentials
- mobs can drop their spawn-egg at a 2% chance
- right-click crops to harvest them
- right-clicking with seeds will fill the farmland in a small radius (gif below)
- added recipes for items that are not craftable by default
