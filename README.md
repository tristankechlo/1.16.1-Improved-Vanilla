# Improved Vanilla

### I made some small changes to Vanilla Minecraft to make the gameplay a little better

### things I changed:

- spawners are mineable with silk-touch pickaxes
- right-click crops to harvest them
- mobs can drop their spawn-egg at a 1% chance
- (1.16 only) right-click spawner to open GUI and edit the potential spawns
  - number of spawn-eggs inside is the chance that this spawn gets picked next, in comparison to other spawn-eggs
  - same number of spawn-eggs means: the entities have the same chance to be spawned next
  - number of spawn-eggs A is twice as high as number of spawn-eggs B means: entity A has chance twice as high as entity B  
  - number of spawn-eggs won't effect the number of spawned entities
   
   
  
  
config-file can be found in path-to-Minecraft-Folder/'Save-Name'/serverconfig/improvedvanilla-server.toml
